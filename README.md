- Hello, I'm Alyssa!
- I am a Computer Science major trying to explore different coding languages and make new projects, both for fun and for my classes.
- I minor in Studio Art, so I try to incorporate some form of art into my code when I can.
- My email is AQuisito@Arcadia.edu for any who needs to contact me.
- I am brand new to github, so I am still figuring out how to organize my stuff here!
